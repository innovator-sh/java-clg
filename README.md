## Running a Java program
Run `javac <file_name>.java` to compile the program. 

If no errors encountered, now run `java <file_name>`

## Running an Applet
Run `javac <file_name>.java`

Now run `appletviewer <file_name>.java`

**Note:** Make sure you have an older version of JDK i.e. v8. Since Applet is deprecated in the newer versions.
